A useful experimental Bugzilla client demonstrating modern Web application technologies such as CSS3, DOM4, HTML5, ECMAScriptÂ 6 and WAI-ARIA.

**Update**: We have decided to abandon BzDeck and instead bring all the UX innovations to Bugzilla to help make it a modernized, productive, competitive issue tracking system. See our [Project Update](https://github.com/bzdeck/bzdeck/wiki/Project-Update) for details.

## How to run the app locally

BzDeck is mostly written in static HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but you need PHP as well to combine CSS/JavaScript files and handle the authentication explained below with a SQLite database.

Note that sqlite is provided by the *php-pdo* package on many RPM-based distros.

### Apache + PHP

Nothing special, just set up a normal local server.

1. Fork this repository
2. Add a new virtual host in your Apache config as below
3. Add a new host in your `/etc/hosts`: `127.0.0.1 local.bzdeck.com`
4. Restart your Apache server with PHP 5.4+ enabled
5. Open `http://local.bzdeck.com/` in your browser

Apache config example:
```conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName local.bzdeck.com
  DocumentRoot "/path/to/bzdeck/webroot/"
</VirtualHost>
```

### PHP only

If you want to run a local development server without Apache, do the following:

1. Install PHP >= 5.4.0 (e.g. In Ubuntu 14.04: `sudo apt-get install php5`)
2. Run `bin/run_dev_server.sh`
3. Open your browser ([Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/) or [Firefox Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/)), go to `http://localhost:8000`

### Sign in

Due to the [updated Authentication Delegation implementation](https://github.com/bzdeck/bzdeck/issues/298) that requires 2 HTTP requests, it's now difficult to sign in to Bugzilla with a local server through the standard process. However, you can still sign in programmatically by entering the following code to the browser's Web Console:

```js
BzDeck.controllers.session.verify_account('(Server ID)', '(Your Bugzilla ID)', '(Your API key)');
```

The server ID will be `mozilla-dev` ([testing](https://bugzilla-dev.allizom.org/)) or `mozilla` ([production](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/)). Your API key can be generated on the Preferences page of each Bugzilla instance.

## Debug mode

Append `?debug=true` to any BzDeck URL to enable the debug mode. All the JavaScript files will be served separately and some debug messages will get dumped.

If some API tests are required, a Bugzilla instance for testing is available at [bugzilla-dev.allizom.org](https://bugzilla-dev.allizom.org/). Ask your password on [IRC](ircs://irc.mozilla.org:6697/bmo) or sign in with your GitHub account. Once a new API key is generated on the Preferences page, sign out from BzDeck and load the app again by appending `?debug=true&server=dev` to the URL.
